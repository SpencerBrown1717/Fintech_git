All while the broader market falls. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I have yet to find a company who has been able to simplify the system and explain crypto to a grandmother. Similar to how apple makes there products simple to use. I belvie there is a great opurtunity for a companie to simplify crypto. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I stil belive crypto and even traditional banking use jargon and terminology that is hard for everyday citizens to learn. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Aptos would have to invest into an intuitive UI and it would need to be simple and require no coding, It would have to be on a smart phone but still incredbuily secure. So its a tall ask, but the pay out is liklie worth it. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

With broader adoption i belive they can tap into new markets and start to help people insted of makeing just intelectuals and tech junkies rich.
